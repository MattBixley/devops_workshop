This new feature, Quarto manuscripts, includes the ability to produce a bundled output containing a standardized journal format, source documents, source computations, referenced resources, and execution information into a single bundle that is ingested into journal review and production processes. We’ll demo how Quarto manuscripts work and how you can incorporate them into your current manuscript development process as well as touch on pain points in your current workflow that Quarto manuscripts help alleviate.\nSlides\nWhat’s New in Quarto?\nCharlotte Wickham, Developer Educator, Quarto, Posit, PBC\nIt’s been over a year since Quarto 1.0, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system, was announced at rstudio::conf(2022). In this talk, I’ll highlight some of the improvements to Quarto since then. You’ll learn about new formats, options, tools, and ways to supercharge your content. And, if you haven’t used Quarto yet, come to see some reasons to try it out.\nCharlotte’s Slides\nQuarto 1.4 will have ability to embed/link images and chunks from Python Notebooks.\n##### Quarto Resources\nhttps://andreaczhang.github.io/qtwAcademic/\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/publishing/\nhttps://jadeynryan.github.io/2023_posit-parameterized-quarto/#/title-slide"

With over 10,000 water bodies across the state, having up-to-date data and decision support is critical. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have created four complex R and Python models to support lake managers, all pulled together and presented with the most recent infestation data available. Come along with us to see how we connected these models in the AIS Explorer, a decision support application built in Shiny to help prioritize risks and placing watercraft inspectors, using tools like OCPU and cloud toolings like Lambda, EventBridge and AWS S3.\n\nWellington based, Full Service POSIT partner\nbuild shiny apps, worked with ESR on the COVID apps\nrun training"
